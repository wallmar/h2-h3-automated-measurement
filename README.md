# h2-h3-automated-measurement
Tool for automated performance measurement of h2 and h3 by Markus Wallner <mwallner.mmt-b2018@fh-salzburg.ac.at>

## Dependencies
* Latest version of Firefox Nightly. After installation go to about:config and set __network.http.http3.enabled__ to __true__
* Manually installed Nginx from quic-branch. Refer to https://hg.nginx.org/nginx-quic/file/quic/README for installation. But use this command for configuration (this also enables http2):<br/><br/>
  __./auto/configure --with-debug --with-http_v3_module --with-cc-opt="-I../boringssl/include" --with-ld-opt="-L../boringssl/build/ssl -L../boringssl/build/crypto" --with-http_v2_module__ <br/><br/>(Please note that nginx requires boringssl)

## Configuration
* In ``config.js`` replace the variable __harFilesPath__ with your Path to the Firefox-Trunk-HAR-Files. If you specified another Directory for your nginx-installation, also change __nginxPath__
* TODO: config-Files f√ºr vhosts und nginx

## Usage
e.g. for with 100ms latency, 2 % loss and 1024 bandwidth (performed for HTTP/3 and HTTP/2)

``node main.js 100 0.02 1024``

This creates an entry in results.xlsx. If the file does not exist, it is created automatically. If a measurement is performed with the same parameters, the entry in results.xlsx is replaced.

___Important:__ Before starting the measurement, close all instances of Firefox Nightly_
