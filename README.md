# h2-h3-automated-measurement
Tool for automated performance measurement of h2 and h3 by Markus Wallner <mwallner.mmt-b2018@fh-salzburg.ac.at>

## Dependencies
* Latest version of Chromium.
* Manually installed Nginx from quic-branch. Refer to https://hg.nginx.org/nginx-quic/file/quic/README for installation. But use this command for configuration (this also enables http2):<br/><br/>
  __./auto/configure --with-debug --with-http_v3_module --with-cc-opt="-I../boringssl/include" --with-ld-opt="-L../boringssl/build/ssl -L../boringssl/build/crypto" --with-http_v2_module__ <br/><br/>_Please note that nginx requires boringssl_

## Configuration
* In ``config.js`` replace the variable __downloadsPath__ with your Downloads-Location for Chromium. If you specified another Directory for your nginx-installation, also change __nginxPath__
* Add the Chrome Extension in ``/chrome-extension`` to Chromium (this enables auto-download of HAR):
  1. Open Chromium
  2. Go to __chrome://extensions/__
  3. Enable Developer Mode
  4. Click at __"Load unpacked"__ and select the ``/chrome-extension``-folder from this repository
* Generate a self-signed certificate and import the authority to Chromium [see Answer at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60516812)
  * The .crt-file must be ``/etc/ssl/self-signed/h2-h3.crt``
  * The .key-file for the server (not CA) must be ``/etc/ssl/self-signed/h2-h3.key``
</br></br>_Please note that you have to specify all hosts as DNS.x in the .ext-File_. [example with 50 hosts](./nginx-config/example.ext)

## Usage
e.g. for with 100ms latency, 2 % loss and 1024 bandwidth (performed for HTTP/3 and HTTP/2)

``node main.js 100 0.02 1024``

This creates entries in results.xlsx. If the file does not exist, it is created automatically. If a measurement is performed with the same parameters, the according entries in results.xlsx is replaced.

___Important:__ Before starting the measurement, close all instances of Chromium_
